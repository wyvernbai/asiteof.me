		<h1>Research interests</h1>
		<p>Now I am mainly interested in machine learning and its applications on NLP and syntactic parsing and its applications.</p>
		<h2>•	Learning Representations for NLP Problems</h2>
		<p>Deep Learning becomes much popular recent years. While more and more researchers in the field of NLP become working on this topic, I’m not exempt either. My research in this direction focuses on learning better representations for NLP problems. I believe that the usage of representations of language structures, rather than using the texts themselves only, could help to better reveal the meanings behind sentences. And the representations can be learned from huge amount of texts in a semi-supervised way.</p>
		<h3>Usage of word embedding learned by Neural Language Models</h3>
		<p>Performed analysis on the properties and usages of word embeddings. Applied word embeddings to NER, Chinese POS-tagging as well as domain adaptation tasks.</p>
		<h3>Multitask learning framework for representations of words, short texts and documents</h3>
		<p>I proposed a multitask learning framework for learning representations of natural languages, which was inspired by the works of Dr. Rie Johnson and Dr. Tong Zhang. I have implemented the basic version of the framework. The codes were then optimized for GPU by other colleagues. I have applied the framework to learn word embeddings for NER and POS tagging, to learn phrase and query representations. I have also applied the method to domain adaptation of SA, which achieved a 0.5% higher result than that of SCL on the amazon dataset.</p>
		<h2>•	Syntactic Parsing and its applications</h2>
		<h3>Domain adaptation for dependency parsing</h3>
		<p>Analyzed the performances of graph-based and transition-based dependency parsers and domain differences of dependency parsing. Researched on domain adaptation methods for dependency parsing.</p>
		<h3>Target-dependent and Context-based Sentiment Analysis</h3>
		<p>Researched on target-dependent (based on information from dependency parsing) and context-based (based on conditional random fields) sentiment analysis for tweets.</p>
		<h3>An Investigation on Semi-supervised Learning of Parsing</h3>
		<p>Worked on smoothing the probabilities estimated by Collins parser by assigning latent variables (topics) to words.</p>
		<h2>•	Machine Learning and its Applications on NLP</h2>
		<h3>Semi-supervised learning and its applications on NLP</h3>
		<p>Extended semi-supervised learning methods (e.g. co-training and label propagation) to handle problems with structured predictions and applied the methods to cross-lingual projection and other NLP tasks. Carried out theoretical analysis on the experimental results. </p>
		<h3>String kernels and its applications</h3>
		<p>Learned the principles of string kernels, e.g. p-spectrum kernels, sub-sequence kernels and weighted gap sub-sequence kernels. Worked on the applications of string kernels to textual classifications.</p>
		<h2>•	Image Retrieval</h2>
		<h3>Re-ranking of results of image retrieval based on Dirichlet Processes (DP)</h3>
		<p>Learned the principle of DP and worked on image clustering using DP with multi-views (textual and visual information) and its application to image search re-ranking.</p>
		<h3>Advertising based on users’ photo collections</h3>
		<p>Extracted topics from images based on the results of image annotation and surrounding texts of the image. Match the images with adverts based on the topic space.</p>
