      <h1>Who is he?</h1>
      <p> Lemao Liu is a 5-th Ph.D. student in the school of computer science and technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, his supervisor is Prof. 
      Tiejun Zhao, a very nice teacher, and he is expected to 
      graduate in this December. Before that, he got 
      his M.S. from the department of mathematics in HIT and B.S. from the department of mathematics in Shangrao Normal College. 
      He was born in a beautiful countryside of Shangrao City, JiangXi, China, and he loves his hometown in his heart. He is a football fan, and 
      a great supporter of Real-Madrid Club for about 12 years.

      <h1>Internship and Work Experiences </h1>
	<h2>•	 Universal Communication Research Institute, NICT, Kyoto, Japan (2012.10.1 to 2013.3.31)</h2>
	<p>He visited the Multilingual Translation Laboratory as an intern and was instructed by Dr. Taro Watanabe (also a very nice teacher as Prof. Zhao). Their research topics were neural networks based SMT model and discriminative training for SMT.</p>

   	<div class="line-3">
		<h1>Research interests</h1>
		<p>Now He is mainly interested in Statistical Machine Translation and its related topics.</p>
    <h2>•	Discriminative training for Statistical Machine Translation</h2>
		<p> Discriminative training is a hot topic in SMT. The goal is going towards stable, efficient, and scalable discriminative training methods, which
		are very helpful for SMT models. </p>
		<h2>•	Nonlinear Translation Models</h2>
		<p> Almost all translation models are based on the log-linear model. As one knows, linear models sometimes suffer from the modeling inadequancy especially 
		when the number of their features is limited. Can anybody go beyond the log-linear model towards nonlinear models with more powerful description ability? </p>
